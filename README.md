# ML_Algorithm_to_check_COVID_Infection
Using Logistic Regression the algorithm is trained with assumed data to detect the probability of infection


# Errors yet to deal #
There are few errors
1) Data isn't accurate
2) The probablitiy is incorrect

Also the main.py file contains file 

# Jupyter Notebooks to train data #
The data.csv file is trained on Jupyter server
The probability is correct on the jupyter sever the flaws are observed in the Flask sever while obtaining data from the user.
